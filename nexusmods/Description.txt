[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. You need the [b]UE4SS_v{version nummber}.zip [/b] (e.g.  UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]DuplicateItems[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\DuplicateItems\[/i]
Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\DuplicateItems\
[/i][/size]5. Done, you can change mod's hotkey, if you want (see below).

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
Currently the mod has only the option to change the toggle key. Default is [b]F5[/b].
1. Navigate deep into mods directory to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be in: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\DuplicateItems\scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. You can modify the [b]ToggleModKey[/b] and [b]ToggleModKeyModifiers[/b] variables.
[size=2]You can find examples and possible Key and ModifierKey values in the UE4SS documentation.
See: [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/key.md]Key[/url] and [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/modifierkey.md]ModifierKey[/url][/size]
4. Don't forget to save your changes.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]How to use[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]The mod is fairly easy to use. [/size]
[list][*]When you press mod's toggle key (Default F5) the mod will print to game's chat it's new state (Enabled/Disabled).  
[*]Mod's chat message should only be visible to you. (untested)
[*]You can toggle the mod any time, even if the chat is not visible.
[*]While the mod is enabled, each time you move an Item between any inventory slots, it will double it's stack count. It works for all items and you can always split the stack!
[*]Splitting stacks doesn't trigger the mod, only moving/swapping an item.
[*]The mod works in singleplayer or if you're host [size=2](untested, but technically it should work)[/size].

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Recommended UE4SS settings for better performance[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]If you experience lag spikes, I highly recommend to change this settings.[/size]
1. Navigate to the game directory where you've installed the UE4SS: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]e.g. [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
2. Open [b]UE4SS-settings.ini[/b] with any text editor.
3. Find following entries and change them as following:
[code]bUseUObjectArrayCache = false
GuiConsoleEnabled = 0[/code]
4. Save the file.
[size=2]If you still experience performance issues, write a detailed comment what happens, your PC specs and which mods you use.[/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.
